# Personal K8s Lab

A **personal workspace** for experimenting with cloud-native technologies, focusing on Kubernetes and its ecosystem. This repository contains my hands-on exploration of tools and patterns, and is an active learning environment where I test different approaches and document useful configurations. The implementations here represent work-in-progress experiments rather than production-ready solutions.
